IMO there's something wrong with the tools we use to create art. You can create some awesome stuff with Photoshop and Blender, but it's non-trivial to solve the rest of the "art" problem. 

- The cost of going through the "creative pipeline" is virtually impossible for a single person to manage on their own 
(i.e. `writing -> illustration -> music/sound -> animation`). 
- The only way to make it worthwhile is to deal with all of the sharing and distribution at the same time 
(i.e. social channels like twitter, instagram, patreon, etc.)

# Animation from First Principles

Gone are the days of big tech. We break into big art now. 

_How do we make it better, faster, and cheaper to produce legendary animations?_

There are probably a handful of animation studios who are given the opportunity to take on the majority of big name adaptations. 

- CloverWorks
- MAPPA
- WiT Studio
- Madhouse
- Ufotable

If you've watched [Bleach TYBW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach:_Thousand-Year_Blood_War), [Demon Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Slayer:_Kimetsu_no_Yaiba), [Spy x Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family), or even [Bocchi The Rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bocchi_the_Rock!) - you'll know that the animation is incredible. Below I dropped some gifs to highlight how different animations are awesome for their own unique reasons.

It's clear that realism and detail is not the thing that makes an animation great
- Characters in bocchi are animated with an endless number of unique expressions and in all of her fantasy scenarios
- In spy x family, all of the movement, camera perspectives, and 2d shader effects are super clean
- For an anime that has been around this long, Hyouka has some pretty awesome details for a relatively 
- Pixar lamp doesn't need a million degrees of freedom to "look alive"

## A Mental Model for Animation

In my mind, animation is pretty much the holy grail of creative efforts. It's incredibly rare to find a creative person who can assemble all of the resources required to make art come to life.
- text-based content (i.e. characters, plot, dialogue, etc.)
- audio-based content
  - voice actors
  - sound staging
  - musical composition
- illustrations (i.e. hand-drawn images, social media content, etc.)

Finally, animation has to tie it all together somehow by mapping the right voice actor to a character, mapping dialogue to mouth movements, character models, artistic interpretation, and the list goes on...

If you can clean up the pipeline of content creation along the way, the average person could go a pretty long way in making it all happen.
